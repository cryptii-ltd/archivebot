<h1 align=center>ArchiveBot (Next)</h1>

This is the frontend for the **Discord Archive Bot**, a platform that allows users to seamlessly archive, manage, and share their Discord conversations. This project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and offers a clean and user-friendly interface for viewing and organizing archived messages.

## Getting Started

To get started with development, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:cryptii-ltd/archivebot.git
    cd abnext
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    Install the necessary packages:

    ```
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Setup Environment Files:**

    You'll need to configure the `.env` and `.env.local` files for Prisma and Next.js, respectively. Examples are provided in the repository (`.env.example` and `.env.local.example`), so copy these files and fill in the necessary details:

    ```
    cp .env.example .env
    cp .env.local.example .env.local
    ```

4.  **Setup the Database:**

    Before running the development server, you need to pull the existing database schema and generate the necessary Prisma client:

    ```
    npx prisma db pull
    npx prisma generate
    ```

5.  **Run the Development Server:**

    Start the development server:

    ```
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

6.  **Migrate Existing Archives:**

    If you need to migrate current archives to the new relational database schema, use the provided migration script:

    ```
    cd migration
    python -m venv env
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python main.py
    ```

    Remember to set up the `.env` file in the `migration` directory using the provided `.env.example` file.

7.  **Build the Project:**

    Once everything is set up, you can build the project for production:

    ```
    npm run build
    # or
    yarn build
    # or
    pnpm build
    ```
